# To understand an assignment in Python, always read the right-hand side first: thatâ€™s where the object is created or retrieved. 
# After that, the variable on the left is bound to the object, like a label stuck to it. 
# Just forget about the boxes.

charles = {'name': 'Charles L. Dodgson', 'born':1832}
lewis = charles
print(lewis is charles) # dict is a mutable type
print(id(charles), id(lewis))

alex = {'name': 'Charles L. Dodgson', 'born': 1832, 'balance': 950}
print(alex == charles) # the object compare equal
print(alex is not charles) # but they are distinct objects (identity comparison)

# == operator compares the values of objects (the data they hold)
# is compares their identities

# if you are coparing a variable to a singleton, then it makes senes to use is
# the most common case is checking whether a variable is bound to None
# x is None
# x is not None

# Tuple is immutable

print(l2 == l1)
print(l2 is l1)

# For lists and other mutable sequences, the shortcut l2 = l1[:] 
# also makes a copy. (Shallow copy)
# the outermost container is duplicated but the copy is filled with 
# references to the same item held by the original container
# it saves memory and causes no problems if all the items are immutable
